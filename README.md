   USE users;

   -- Set up the user_info table
   CREATE TABLE user_info(
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
       accountType VARCHAR(255),
       databaseName VARCHAR(255),
       userPass VARCHAR(255),
       creator_name VARCHAR(255),
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );

   -- Create a new table for JWT tokens
   CREATE TABLE tokens (
       token_id VARCHAR(767) PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id INT,
       expiration DATETIME DEFAULT (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 30 MINUTE),
       revoked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
       FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user_info(id)
   );

   -- Set up the user_activity table
   CREATE TABLE user_activity(
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id INT,
       ip_address VARCHAR(50),
       user_agent VARCHAR(255),
       operating_system VARCHAR(255),
       activity_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user_info(id)
   );
   ```

Now, your MariaDB database named 'users' should have three tables: 'user_info', 'tokens', and 'user_activity'. These tables are designed according to the provided SQL code.

## Install

 GIT for the VM Server

1. **Install Git:**
   - If you haven't installed Git yet, you can do so using the following commands:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install git
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   mkdir rapportsystem-backend
   cd rapportsystem-backend
   git clone https://github.com/Bjorgeh/rapportsystem-backend.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the SQLconnections Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd rapportsystem-backend/SQLconnections
   ```

4. **Create `secret.py` File:**
   ```bash
   touch secret.py
   ```

5. **Edit `secret.py` File:**
   - Use your preferred text editor to edit the `secret.py` file. For example:
   ```bash
   nano secret.py
   ```

   Add the following content to `secret.py`:
   ```python
   # Sets app config
   host_IP = 'YOUR SQL SERVER IP'
   host_user = 'YOUR ADMIN USER'
   host_password = 'YOUR ADMIN PASSWORD'
   host_database = None
   host_userdatabase = "users"
   host_users_table = "user_info"
   host_session_table = "tokens"

   # This is used in API.py to apply config
   def setConfig(app):
       app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'TESTKEY'
       app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'SUPER_SECRET_KEY'
       return 1
   ```

6. **Save and Exit:**
   - In Nano, press `Ctrl + X` to exit, press `Y` to confirm changes, and press `Enter`.

## Conclusion

You have now cloned the repository, created the `secret.py` file, and added the required content. This file will be utilized for database connections and configuration in your application. Adjust the file as needed for your specific setup.

## Install Python, Frameworks, and Requirements

In your Linux VM terminal, install the following:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.12
sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip
```

Now that you have Python and PIP installed, proceed to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python Flask flask-restx flask-session bcrypt httpagentparser flask-cors flask-jwt-extended
```

If the VM won't let the install complete, try adding `--break-system-packages` at the end of the one-liner like this:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python Flask flask-restx flask-session bcrypt httpagentparser flask-cors flask-jwt-extended --break-system-packages
```

## Setup the Screen Plugin for Linux

If you want to run the `API.py` file using `screen` on your Linux distribution, follow these steps:

1. **Install `screen` (if not already installed):**
   - Use the package manager for your Linux distribution to install `screen`. For Ubuntu/Debian, you can use:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install screen
   ```

2. **Start a New `screen` Session:**
   ```bash
   screen
   ```

3. **Run `API.py` in the `screen` Session:**
   - Navigate to the directory where `API.py` is located (in your case, it should be in `rapportsystem-backend`). Then, run:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 API.py
   ```

4. **Detach from the `screen` Session:**
   - To detach from the `screen` session and leave the process running in the background, press `Ctrl + A`, followed by `Ctrl + D`.

5. **Reattach to the `screen` Session (if needed):**
   - If you need to reattach to the `screen` session later, use:
   ```bash
   screen -r
   ```

## Conclusion

Now, your `API.py` is running in the background within a `screen` session. This helps keep the application running even after you close the terminal or log out.

Make sure to monitor the application's logs or screen session for any output or errors. Adjust the process as needed based on your specific requirements and monitoring preferences.

## Interacting with Swagger UI for Your API

1. **Access Swagger UI:**
   - Ensure your API is running. If not, follow the steps in the previous guide.
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the Swagger UI endpoint. Typically, it's at `http://your_server_ip:port/api`.

2. **Explore Endpoints:**
   - Swagger UI presents a user-friendly interface showcasing available API endpoints.
   - Explore endpoints, parameters, request bodies, and expected responses.

3. **Test API Requests:**
   - Use Swagger UI to test API requests directly from the interface.
   - Input parameters, adjust request bodies, and execute requests to see live responses.

4. **Understand Responses:**
   - Review detailed information about each API operation, including response codes and data formats.

5. **Interactive Documentation:**
   - Swagger UI serves as interactive documentation, making it easy for users to understand and interact with your API.

## Conclusion

You've successfully set up your API and Swagger UI. Users can now explore, test, and understand your API's functionalities using the Swagger user interface.

Note: Ensure that your Swagger UI endpoint matches your API setup and update any placeholder values accordingly. If you encounter issues, check the API logs and Swagger UI documentation for troubleshooting.
